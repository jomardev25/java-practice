/*
 * Title: Bridge Design Pattern
 * URL: https://howtodoinjava.com/design-patterns/structural/bridge-design-pattern
 * Description:
 * Bridge design pattern is used to decouple a class into two parts – abstraction and it’s implementation – so that both can evolve in future without affecting each other.
 * It increases the loose coupling between class abstraction and it’s implementation.
