 * Title: Design Patterns
 * URL: https://howtodoinjava.com/gang-of-four-java-design-patterns
 * Description:
 * Behavioral patterns abstract an action we want to take on the object or class that takes the action.
 * By changing the object or class, we can change the algorithm used, the objects affected, or the behavior, while still retaining the same basic interface for client classes.
