 * Title: Design Patterns
 * URL: https://howtodoinjava.com/gang-of-four-java-design-patterns
 * Description:
 * Creational patterns often used in place of direct instantiation with constructors.
 * They make the creation process more adaptable and dynamic.
 * In particular, they can provide a great deal of flexibility about which objects are created, how those objects are created, and how they are initialized.
